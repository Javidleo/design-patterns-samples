this is a basic sample of prototype pattern with explanation

## what we found out of it? 
well, it's worthy to use when the creation of an object is expensive, or you create objects of same type with really similar data

basically, you don't need to create the object again if you need the same thing with some changes, 

you can copy it and make the changes on the copy, it depends on your scenario but 

c# introduced the 'Record' which solves the same problem. 

I didn't get anything else more from this pattern.
